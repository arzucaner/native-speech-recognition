# Native Speech Recognition

---

## The Wes Bos Challenge 30 project "Native Speech Recognition" is a web development project that focuses on using the built-in Web Speech API of modern web browsers to enable speech recognition in a web application. The project involves building a simple speech recognition tool that can listen to and transcribe spoken words and phrases in real-time.

The project typically involves creating a user interface that allows users to start and stop the speech recognition process, as well as displaying the transcribed text as it is recognized. Additionally, the project may involve implementing various features, such as the ability to recognize specific words or phrases, or to respond to voice commands with specific actions.

Overall, the Wes Bos Challenge 30 project "Native Speech Recognition" is a fun and challenging project that allows web developers to explore the exciting possibilities of speech recognition technology in web applications.

This is the twenty-one project of the JavaScript30 Challenge.  This is a speech synthesis project built with the web speech API to convert text to speech.
